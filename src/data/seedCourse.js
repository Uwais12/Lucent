The bottleneck isn't usually the CPU power needed for a single request, but rather how efficiently the system can store, retrieve, search, and manage large amounts of data concurrently. These applications rely heavily on standard building blocks like databases, caches, message queues, and search indexes to manage this data effectively.",

Half of user requests are faster than this, half are slower. Represents the typical experience.\n* **p95, p99, p99.9:** High percentiles show **tail latencies**. For example, the p99 is the response time threshold that 99% of requests are faster than (or, equivalently, the slowest 1% of requests take at least this long).\n\nHigh percentiles are important because users with slow requests might be those with more data (valuable customers) or those making complex requests. Optimizing high percentiles directly improves the experience for the worst-affected users.\n\n**Tail Latency Amplification:** In systems where serving a single user request requires calls to multiple backend services, the probability of the end-user request being slow increases.

                "**Stateless services** (like typical web application servers) are relatively easy to scale horizontally. Any incoming request can be routed to any available server because servers don't need to maintain specific user session data between requests (state is often stored elsewhere, e.g., in a database or cache).\n\n**Stateful systems** (like databases, message queues, or services maintaining session state) are much harder to scale out. When data (state) needs to be distributed across multiple nodes, new challenges arise:\n* How do you ensure requests for specific data reach the correct node?\n* How do you replicate data across nodes for fault tolerance and read scaling?\n* How do you maintain consistency when data is updated across multiple replicas?\n* How do you handle node failures and rebalance data?\n\nManaging distributed state adds significant complexity compared to scaling stateless components.",

Documents can have nested structures, allowing related data to be kept together (e.g., user profile including addresses and order history within the main user document).

This allows efficient merging (like mergesort) and efficient lookups (keys within a segment can be found quickly). A sparse in-memory index can point to key ranges within the SSTable.\n2.  **Memtable:** Incoming writes go to an in-memory balanced tree structure (e.g., AVL tree, Red-Black tree), called the **memtable**, which keeps keys sorted.\n3.  **Flushing:** When the memtable reaches a certain size, it's written out to disk as a new SSTable segment.\n4.  **Compaction:** Background processes merge older SSTable segments and discard overwritten/deleted values.\n5.  **Write-Ahead Log (WAL):** To prevent data loss if the memtable crashes before being flushed, writes are typically first appended to an on-disk WAL.\n6.  **Bloom Filters:** Often used to quickly determine if a key *might* exist in an SSTable segment, avoiding unnecessary disk reads for non-existent keys.\n\nLSM-trees provide excellent write performance because writes are mostly sequential appends (to WAL and memtable, then sequential SSTable writes).

Good for columns with moderately low cardinality.\n* General-purpose algorithms (LZ4, Zstandard) can also be applied.\n\nHigh compression ratios reduce disk space usage and speed up queries by reducing the amount of data read from disk.",

This reduces interpretation overhead and better utilizes CPU caches.\n* **Write Handling:** Since updating columnar data in-place is complex, writes are often handled similarly to LSM-trees: data is buffered in a row-oriented format (like a memtable), sorted, converted to columnar format, and then merged into the main columnar storage.",

Handles missing/extra fields based on defined resolution rules (e.g., using default values).\n    * **Compatibility Rules:** Generally safe to add/remove fields that have default values.

Assign multiple partitions to each node. When adding a node, steal some partitions from existing nodes. When removing a node, distribute its partitions among remaining nodes. Minimizes disruption as only whole partitions are moved.\n2.  **Dynamic Partitioning:** Start with few partitions. When a partition grows too large, split it into two. When partitions become too small, merge adjacent ones. Used by systems like HBase. Adapts to data size but can be complex to manage.\n3.  **Partitioning Proportionally to Nodes:** Assign a fixed number of partitions per node. Adding a node means creating new partitions for it (less common, harder to balance).\n\nConsistent hashing is often used with fixed partitions to determine assignments.",

Simple for clients, but adds network hops.\n2.  **Routing Tier / Proxy:** Client sends requests to a stateless routing layer (proxy).

                "**Write Skew** is a subtle anomaly that can occur even under Snapshot Isolation. It happens when two transactions read overlapping sets of objects, make decisions based on those reads, and then write to *different* objects, such that the writes violate an invariant that depends on the reads.\n\n* **Example (Doctors On Call):** Two doctors check if at least one doctor is on call. Both see one doctor is on call. Both decide they can go off call. Both update their *own* status. Result: No doctors on call, violating the invariant. Each transaction read valid data from its snapshot, but the writes conflict implicitly.\n\nWrite skew occurs because the writes don't directly conflict on the *same* object, so simple locking or Snapshot Isolation doesn't prevent it. The conflict is based on the *premise* of the write (the data read earlier).",

Transaction B inserts a new user with `age = 35`. Transaction A runs the count query again and gets a different result.\n\nSnapshot Isolation prevents phantoms caused by *updates* to existing rows matching the `WHERE` clause, but it typically doesn't prevent phantoms caused by newly *inserted* rows.

Simple, but limits throughput.\n* **Two-Phase Locking (2PL):** Uses extensive locking (shared read locks, exclusive write locks) to prevent conflicts. Strict 2PL holds locks until commit. Prone to deadlocks and poor performance under contention.\n* **Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI):** An optimistic approach built on Snapshot Isolation. Tracks reads/writes and detects dangerous patterns (read/write conflicts across transactions) at commit time, aborting transactions if serializability would be violated.
